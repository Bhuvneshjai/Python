# Problem Statement:-
# Generate a random integer from a to b. You and your friend have to
# guess a number between two numbers, a and b. a and b are inputs
# taken from the user. Your friend is player 1 and plays first.
# He will have to keep choosing the number, and your program must
# tell whether the number is greater than the actual number or less
# than the actual number. Log the number of trials it took your
# friend to arrive at the number. You play the same game, and then
# the person with the minimum number of trials wins! Randomly generate
# a number after taking a and b as input and donâ€™t show that to the
# user.

# Input:
# Enter the value of a
# 4

# Enter the value of b
# 13

# Output:
# Player1 :
# Please guess the number between 4 and 13
# 5

# Wrong guess a greater number again
# 8

# Wrong guess a smaller number again
# 6

# Correct, you took 3 trials to guess the number

# Player 2:
# Correct, you took 7 trials to guess the number

# Player 1 wins!
